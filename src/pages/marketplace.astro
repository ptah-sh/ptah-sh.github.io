    <p class="mb-4">The 1-Click Apps Marketplace is a valuable resource for developers and businesses. It provides a wide range of pre-configured applications and services that can be deployed with a single click. This saves time and effort, allowing users to focus on their core tasks rather than setting up and configuring applications.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why You Should Use Self-Hosted Apps</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Self-hosted applications offer numerous advantages that make them an attractive option for businesses and individuals alike:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Data Control and Privacy:</strong> With self-hosted apps, you have complete control over your data. It remains on your servers, reducing the risk of data breaches and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.</li>
      <li><strong>Customization and Flexibility:</strong> Self-hosted solutions allow for greater customization to fit your specific needs. You can modify the code, add features, or integrate with other systems more easily.</li>
      <li><strong>Cost-Effectiveness:</strong> While there may be initial setup costs, self-hosted apps can be more cost-effective in the long run, especially for larger organizations or high-usage scenarios.</li>
      <li><strong>Performance Control:</strong> You can optimize the hardware and network infrastructure to ensure the best performance for your specific use case.</li>
      <li><strong>Independence:</strong> Self-hosting reduces reliance on third-party services, protecting you from sudden changes in pricing, features, or even service discontinuation.</li>
      <li><strong>Learning Opportunity:</strong> For developers and IT professionals, self-hosting provides valuable experience in server management, security, and application deployment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      With Ptah.sh's 1-Click Apps Marketplace, you can enjoy these benefits of self-hosting while significantly reducing the complexity and time typically associated with setting up and managing self-hosted applications.
