Ptah.sh is a handy tool that makes it easy to manage and deploy services on your own servers.

## Why Ptah.sh

Ptah.sh is a great choice for anyone who wants to manage and deploy services on their own infrastructure. It offers:

- **Full control** over your infrastructure and data.
- **High security** through Docker Swarm and virtual machine security.
- **Easy scalability** with the ability to deploy services in any environment.
- **Open source benefits** for quick resolution of critical vulnerabilities.
- **No vendor lock-in** with configurations stored on the Docker Swarm cluster.
- **Simplified Docker Swarm usage** with a user-friendly interface for managing your Docker Swarm cluster.
- **Effortless server resource monitoring** to ensure optimal performance.
- **Automated backups** for the safety and recoverability of your critical data.

By choosing Ptah.sh, you can focus on your core business while ensuring the reliability and security of your services.

## Quick Guide

<h2 id="architecture">Architecture of Ptah.sh</h2>

Ptah.sh is a [Fair Source](https://fair.io) software consisting of two components:

- **An agent installed on the server** (VPS) that interacts with the system and running Docker Daemon by executing predefined commands (creating-updating-running services and backups).

- **A web-based UI** that allows configuring services, access points, and periodic tasks.

This provides the following guarantees and capabilities:
- Deployment of services in **any environment** with **any provider** of virtual or physical machines, or even in a home office.

- **Virtual machine security** - all ports can be closed while still maintaining the ability to deploy services (for example, for intranet infrastructure).

- Open source code theoretically guarantees **quick resolution of critical vulnerabilities**.

- The Fair Source model also allows **hosting the service on your own hardware**, thus taking control of your entire infrastructure.

- **Docker Swarm**, which is a key element of the system, ensures that all services will be isolated within their networks, organizes the ability to combine multiple nodes into a single cluster, and helps increase the overall reliability of the system.

- **Vendor lock-free**: all configurations are stored on the Docker Swarm cluster, allowing you to discontinue the service at any time while still being able to perform deployments and be confident that your site-application-API won't turn into a pumpkin at midnight.
