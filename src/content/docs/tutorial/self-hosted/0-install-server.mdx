This tutorial will guide you through the process of installing the Ptah.sh Panel on your Virtual Private Server (VPS). If you haven't set up a VPS yet, please refer to our [VPS setup guide](/tutorial/vps) first.

## Prerequisites

- A VPS with SSH access
- Basic knowledge of using the command line

## Installation Steps

1. **Connect to your VPS**

   Use SSH to connect to your VPS. The command typically looks like this:

   ```bash
   ssh username@your_server_ip
   ```

   Replace `username` and `your_server_ip` with your actual SSH username and server IP address.

2. **Run the installation command**

   Once connected to your VPS, run one of the following commands:

   <Tabs>
   <TabItem value="curl" label="Using curl">

   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://r.ptah.sh/install-server | bash
   ```

   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="wget" label="Using wget">

   ```bash
   wget -qO- https://r.ptah.sh/install-server | bash
   ```

   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

   This command will download and execute the installation script.

3. **Answer the configuration questions**

   During the installation process, you'll be prompted to answer two important questions:

   a) **Advertise address for Docker Swarm**
      - This is typically a private IP address that other Swarm nodes will use to connect to this node.
      - If your VPS is on a private network, you should choose the private IP address.
      - The script will present you with a list of available IP addresses. Choose the appropriate one for your setup.

   b) **Public IP address of the server**
      - This is the IP address where the panel will be accessible from the internet.
      - It's usually the public IP address of your VPS.
      - The script will again present you with a list of available IP addresses. Select the correct public IP.

4. **Wait for the installation to complete**

   The script will proceed to:
   - Install Docker
   - Run the ptah-server Docker container
   - Install the Ptah.sh agent
   - Install and configure the Docker Ingress Routing Daemon (DIRD)
   - Set up systemd services for the Ptah.sh Agent and DIRD
   - Configure all necessary components

5. **Note your admin credentials**

   At the end of the installation process, the script will output the admin user email and a randomly generated password. Make sure to save these credentials securely, as you'll need them to log in to your Ptah.sh Dashboard.

6. **Access your Ptah.sh Dashboard**

   Once the installation is complete, you can access your Ptah.sh Dashboard by navigating to:

   ```
   http://your_public_ip/dashboard
   ```

   Replace `your_public_ip` with the public IP address you selected during the installation.

## Conclusion

You have now successfully installed the Ptah.sh Panel on your VPS. You can log in to your dashboard using the provided admin email (typically `self-hosted@localhost`) and the generated password.

Remember to change your password after your first login for security reasons.
