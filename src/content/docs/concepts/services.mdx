Services are the main building blocks of the Ptah.sh system.

## Processes

The services are represented by the "processes" in the system. Each process defines its own configuration and behavior.

For example, the PostgreSQL service may be defined as two processes: PostgreSQL server itself and pgpool to run as a sidecar container.

### Workers

Additionally, each process may have additional workers (sidecar containers) that are used to run additional processes or services that are not part of the main process. They maintain the same environment variables and configuration files as the main process.

### Release Command

Each process may also have a release command that is executed when the service is started.

### Backup Command

Each process may also have a backup command that is executed when the service is stopped.

### Volumes

Each process may also have a list of volumes that are mounted to the container.

### Environment Variables

Each process may also have a list of environment variables that are set on the container.

### Configuration Files

Each process may also have a list of configuration files that are mounted to the container.

### Port and Endpoint Configuration

Each process may also have a list of ports and endpoints that are exposed to the server node / internet.

## 1-Click Apps

1-Click Apps are preconfigured applications that are deployed to the server node. They can be used to deploy any service or process that is not part of the system. We recommend using 1-Click Apps to deploy any service that is not part of the system.
