This section describes the key concepts implemented in Ptah.sh, providing an overview of the platform's architecture and functionality.

## Core Concepts

### Nodes

Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of the Ptah.sh platform. They represent physical or virtual servers that host services and are managed by Docker Swarm. For more details, see the [Nodes](/concepts/nodes/) page.

### Services

Services are the main functional units in Ptah.sh. They define the configuration and behavior of your applications. Each service consists of one or more processes. Learn more on the [Services](/concepts/services/) page.

### Docker Registries

Ptah.sh supports both public and private Docker registries for storing and distributing container images. Understanding how to work with registries is crucial for managing your services effectively. Explore more on the [Docker Registries](/concepts/docker-registries/) page.

### S3 Storages

S3-compatible storage integration enhances data management and backup capabilities in Ptah.sh. This feature allows for scalable and secure storage solutions. Dive deeper into this topic on the [S3 Storages](/concepts/s3-storages/) page.

### 1-Click Apps

1-Click Apps provide pre-configured application templates that can be quickly deployed, saving time and ensuring best practices. Learn how to leverage this feature on the [1-Click Apps](/concepts/1-click-apps/) page.

## Platform Architecture

Ptah.sh is built on a robust architecture that leverages Docker Swarm for orchestration, providing:

- High availability and fault tolerance
- Easy scaling of services
- Efficient resource utilization
- Simplified deployment and management

## Key Features

- **Automated Deployments**: Streamline your CI/CD pipeline with Ptah.sh's automated deployment capabilities.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Keep track of your services' health and performance with built-in monitoring and logging tools.
- **Load Balancing**: Automatically distribute traffic across your services for optimal performance.
- **Security**: Implement best practices in security with features like secret management and isolated networks.

## Getting Started

To begin using Ptah.sh effectively, we recommend:

1. Familiarizing yourself with the core concepts outlined in this section.
2. Exploring the detailed documentation for each concept.
3. Setting up your first node and deploying a simple service to get hands-on experience.

By understanding these fundamental concepts, you'll be well-equipped to leverage the full power of Ptah.sh for your application deployment and management needs.
