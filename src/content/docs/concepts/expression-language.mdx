description: Learn about the expression language used in Ptah.sh for dynamic configuration
---

Ptah.sh uses an expression language based on Handlebars in various areas such as environment variables, secret variables, and Caddy configuration. This feature is particularly useful in 1-click app templates, enabling dynamic and flexible configurations.

## Available Functions

The following Handlebars helpers are available in the expression language:

### base64Encode

Encodes a string to base64.

Usage:

```
{{ base64Encode "Hello, World!" }}
```

### randomBytes

Generates random bytes and returns them as a hexadecimal string.

Usage:

```
{{ randomBytes length=16 }}
```

The `length` parameter is optional and defaults to 32.

### randomUsername

Generates a random username using a combination of an adjective and a noun.

Usage:

```
{{ randomUsername }}
```

Example output: ```happy_dog```

### randomPassword

Generates a random password.

Usage:

```
{{ randomPassword }}
```

The `length` parameter is optional and defaults to 42.

Note: Special characters are excluded to ensure compatibility with various systems, such as database URL templates.

### randomString

Generates a random string of specified length using an extended character set with special characters.

Usage:

```
{{ randomString length=10 }}
```

The `length` parameter is optional and defaults to 64.

## Special Variables

In addition to the expression language functions, Ptah.sh provides special variables that can be used in expressions.

### service.internalDomainName

This variable represents the internal domain name assigned to the service within the Ptah.sh environment. It's used to reference the service internally, typically for inter-service communication or database connections.

Usage:

```
pgbouncer.{{ service.internalDomainName }}
```

Example output: ```pgbouncer.postgresql.local```

## Examples

Here are some examples of using these functions in your configurations:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://{{ randomUsername }}:{{ randomPassword }}@localhost/mydb
API_KEY={{ base64Encode (randomBytes length=24) }}
```

These expressions are evaluated when the configuration is applied, providing unique and secure values for your deployments.

### Usage in 1-Click App Templates

In 1-Click App templates, you can use the expression language to dynamically generate values for configuration options. For example:

```json
{
  "ADMIN_PASSWORD": "{{ randomPassword }}",
  "DATABASE_URL": "postgresql://{{ randomUsername }}:{{ randomPassword }}@pg.{{ service.internalDomainName }}/mydb"
}
```

This generates a unique username and password for each deployment, ensuring database security and isolation.

### Advanced Usage

The expression language allows for more complex operations, such as accessing nested properties and combining multiple functions:

```
{{ base64Encode (randomBytes length=16) }}
```

This generates 16 random bytes and encodes the result in base64.

While the expression language is powerful, use it judiciously to maintain readability and maintainability in your configurations.

## Real-world Examples from Marketplace Apps

Here are some examples of how the expression language is used in actual marketplace apps:

1. PostgreSQL:
```json
{
  "POSTGRES_PASSWORD": "{{ randomPassword }}",
  "POSTGRES_USER": "{{ randomUsername }}"
}
```

2. WordPress:
```json
{
  "WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD": "{{ randomPassword }}",
  "WORDPRESS_AUTH_KEY": "{{ randomString length=64 }}",
  "WORDPRESS_SECURE_AUTH_KEY": "{{ randomString length=64 }}",
  "WORDPRESS_LOGGED_IN_KEY": "{{ randomString length=64 }}",
  "WORDPRESS_NONCE_KEY": "{{ randomString length=64 }}"
}
```

3. Redis:
```json
{
  "REDIS_PASSWORD": "{{ randomPassword }}"
}
```

These examples demonstrate how the expression language is used to generate secure, random values for various configuration settings in real applications.
