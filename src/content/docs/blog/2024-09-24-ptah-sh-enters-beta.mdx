We are excited to announce that the core of Ptah.sh is now complete, and more than 20 services are running in production. It's been 3 weeks since the official launch of Ptah.sh, and we have some exciting updates to share with you. We've been hard at work finalizing the core set of features that set Ptah.sh apart from other platforms. Today marks one of the largest releases in recent weeks.

## Sensitive Data Encryption

The highlight of this release is our new sensitive data encryption feature, which is enabled by default for all users.

We value your data, and every secret you have will never reach Ptah.sh servers: each will be encrypted in your browser and transferred safely to your Docker Swarm.

This is by far the most important feature on the platform, even more important than the core feature - Docker Swarm management itself.

Your data is important, and we want to give you the most security layers possible. Browser-side secret encryption is just one of the first pieces of the composition.

One day we'll fight for a SOC2 compliance certificate.

## New Pricing for Hobby Plan

Ptah.sh was born out of a tiny startup and we've always been thinking about how to improve the lives of indie developers or tiny businesses.

Today we are re-imagining the price on the Hobby plan: now it is just $4.75/mo with a yearly payment upfront.

Unfortunately, we can't make it as a monthly subscription, as the commissions will eat a major part of this sum which will make the revenue unsustainable to keep the low price tag.

The self-hosted option will stay free.

## What's Next?

The next big feature on our roadmap is comprehensive server health monitoring. This will include detailed metrics on CPU, RAM, and disk usage, allowing you to keep a close eye on your server's performance and ensure everything is running smoothly.

We are also planning to update the UX and introduce real-time task monitoring.

Stay tuned for more updates!

## Conclusion

We are thrilled to bring these new features and pricing to our users. Your feedback and support have been invaluable in shaping Ptah.sh into what it is today. We look forward to continuing this journey with you and can't wait to share more exciting updates in the future. Thank you for being a part of our community!

Stay tuned for more updates!
