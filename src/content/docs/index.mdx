    ## Special Thanks

    _These are the people and communities who made the Ptah.sh possible. The list is not exhaustive, but we're trying our best._

    <p class="not-content pt-4">
    - <Twitter handle="heyandras" name="Andras Bacsai" /> who inspired me (<Twitter handle="b_shulha" name="Bohdan Shulha" />) to finally convert my devops-y experience into a service. In the last couple of years, I have been configuring deployments a lot, and playing with different clouds (Google, AWS, DO, k8s, ECS). Andras has shown that my experience can be converted into something more than a bunch of hand-written scripts & customizations.
    - <Twitter handle="marc_louvion" name="Marc Lou" /> as one of the most prominent persons in the Build in Public community. 
    - <Twitter handle="fairsrc" name="Fair Source" /> (<a href="https://fair.io/?utm_source=ptah.sh" target="_blank">fair.io</a>) organization, who makes the enormous commitment into open source distribution model.

        <div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
          <p itemprop="text">While Ptah.sh shares some similarities with Coolify and CapRover, it has several key differences:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>**Commercial Focus**: Ptah.sh uses Fair Source Licensing, allowing for commercialization while still permitting self-hosting for internal needs. This model supports better quality, faster development, and improved customer support.</li>
            <li>**Opinionated Design**: Ptah.sh is more opinionated in its architecture, focusing on simplicity and covering the needs of 80% of small to medium businesses while maintaining an easy-to-use interface.</li>
            <li>**Docker Swarm Only**: Unlike some alternatives, Ptah.sh exclusively uses Docker Swarm as its backend, simplifying development, support, and user experience.</li>
            <li>**Careful Feature Selection**: New features are carefully evaluated to maintain a simplified user experience and attract users and contributors with a similar mindset.</li>

        <div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
          <p itemprop="text">The name Ptah.sh has two parts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ptah</strong> (pronounced /tɑː/ or "TAH"): An ancient Egyptian deity, known as a creator god and patron deity of craftsmen and architects.</li>
            <li><strong>.sh</strong>: Refers to shell scripts, commonly used in DevOps and system administration.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Combining these elements, Ptah.sh symbolizes a "god and patron of DevOps," reflecting our mission to empower developers and system administrators with powerful, easy-to-use tools for managing their infrastructure.</p>
