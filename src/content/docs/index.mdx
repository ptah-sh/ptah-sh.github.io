        <div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
          <p itemprop="text">While Ptah.sh shares some similarities with Coolify and CapRover, it has several key differences:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>**Commercial Focus**: Ptah.sh uses Fair Source Licensing, allowing for commercialization while still permitting self-hosting for internal needs. This model supports better quality, faster development, and improved customer support.</li>
            <li>**Opinionated Design**: Ptah.sh is more opinionated in its architecture, focusing on simplicity and covering the needs of 80% of small to medium businesses while maintaining an easy-to-use interface.</li>
            <li>**Docker Swarm Only**: Unlike some alternatives, Ptah.sh exclusively uses Docker Swarm as its backend, simplifying development, support, and user experience.</li>
            <li>**Careful Feature Selection**: New features are carefully evaluated to maintain a simplified user experience and attract users and contributors with a similar mindset.</li>

        <summary itemprop="name">Why is it called Ptah.sh?</summary>
        <div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
          <p itemprop="text">The name Ptah.sh has two parts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ptah</strong> (pronounced /tɑː/ or "TAH"): An ancient Egyptian deity, known as a creator god and patron deity of craftsmen and architects.</li>
            <li><strong>.sh</strong>: Refers to shell scripts, commonly used in DevOps and system administration.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Combining these elements, Ptah.sh symbolizes a "god and patron of DevOps," reflecting our mission to empower developers and system administrators with powerful, easy-to-use tools for managing their infrastructure.</p>
          <p>Also, in Ukrainian "Ptah" means "Bird" and we're trying the best to fly high and help our customers to do the same.</p>
