    "description": "A cache is a temporary storage location for data that is frequently accessed by the application. It's particularly useful for storing frequently accessed data and for querying data. Caches offer several advantages over traditional relational databases, including better scalability, flexibility, and performance. Additionally, caches are well-suited for applications that require high availability, horizontal scalability, and flexible data models."
